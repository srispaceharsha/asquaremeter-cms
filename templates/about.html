    <h2>What can you find in a square meter if you observe it for a year?</h2>

    <section class="about-section">
        <p></p>
        <p>A very natural question to wonder about, of course. So, at the beginning of this year (2026), I set out to find the answer.</p>

        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>I am Sri Harsha, the human behind this project. I spend about 2–3 hours every day on this square plot, right in my backyard in <a href="https://wildgundmi.com/">Gundmi village</a>.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
        <p>I pick up my camera, crouch near the plot, and stare hard at the square meter plot. After a while, usually, space and time split open and a bug appears! Then I end up kneeling, lying flat on the ground, or somehow standing in a way that hurts my knees a lot, just to take pictures of this bug.</p>
        <p>Then I spend another hour or so staring hard at my computer screen, skimming through these photos, usually shaking my head in disappointment.</p>
        <p>Then it takes about an hour more to figure out what exactly this bug is. As usually happens, I end up 11 links deep into Wikipedia or iNaturalist listings, then wonder why it is night already. Such is the nature of this job. And then I do it all again the next day.</p>
        <p>
        Well, I am a <a href="https://srispaceharsha.com/chapters/sisyphus.html">happy Sisyphus.</a>   
        </p>

        <p>Even though the temptation is high to move a leaf around or gently scoot the bug toward better-lit areas to get a good shot, I have chosen the noble path of restraint so far. <a href="{{ base_url }}/rules.html">Here are the rules I follow</a>.</p>
        <p>I like bugs. I like the struggle of taking a good picture. And I like constraints.</p>
        <p> This project is very similar to that of <a href="https://prairieecologist.com/square-meter-photography-project/"> by Chris Helzer,</a> which I learnt about much later after starting this. He is an inspiration.

    Here I am, disappointed with the photo I just shot.
