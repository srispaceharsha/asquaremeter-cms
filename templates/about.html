        <h2>The Concept</h2>
        <p>{{ config.site_description }}</p>
        <p>
            This project documents every insect, fungus, and other creatures found within a fixed
            1 meter × 1 meter plot of land over the course of one year. By observing this tiny patch
            of earth through all seasons, we may discover the remarkable biodiversity that exists in even
            the smallest spaces.
            Project began on 1st of January, 2026.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A fixed 1m × 1m plot has been marked in {{ config.location.place_name }}</li>
            <li>The plot is visited regularly, (almost) everyday throughout the year</li>
            <li>All visible life forms are photographed and documented</li>
            <li>Weather conditions and moon phases are recorded for each sighting</li>
            <li>Identifications are made to the best of ability, with scientific names when known</li>
            <li>The patch will not be intentionally disturbed</li>
        </ul>
