So it begins.

Hello world!

Welcome to `a square meter` project, here we like bugs. Find more about the project in the `about` section.

Today, I set up the fence posts on 4 corners of `the patch`, cleaned up the space a bit, placed an old wood piece in it. That is it. No more fiddling with `the patch` for the rest of the year. 

Here it is!

My first immediate dilemma is this:

If I spot a bug within the square meter but it moves out of the boundary before I can get a photo, should I still take the picture and count it as a sighting, or should I let it go?
